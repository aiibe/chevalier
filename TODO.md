## Nice-to-have

- **`init/templates/` is a hand-kept parallel of `examples/basic`.** The
  embed/drift-guard is done (`init/templates/` real files → `templates.gen.ts`
  via `deno task gen`, checked in CI by `gen:check`). But the two trees are
  still maintained by hand — a change to the example must be mirrored into the
  template manually (as the loader/quote examples just were). To fully close the
  gap, generate `templates/` _from_ `examples/basic` with declared transforms
  (local-src imports → `jsr:@chevalier/core`, drop the clock demo) rather than
  keeping a second copy.

- **Hydration check not in CI.** `examples/basic` has a headless-Chrome
  hydration smoke test (`deno task check:hydration`) that's macOS-Chrome-path
  specific and not wired into the `ci.yml` workflow. Add a Chrome setup step and
  run it (or the equivalent) against the built example on CI.

- **Island HMR silently degrades without prefresh.** Fast Refresh needs the app
  to provide `@prefresh/vite` (+ `@prefresh/core`/`utils`), resolved at runtime
  via `import.meta.resolve`. If absent, `scopedPrefresh` falls back to default
  HMR — islands reload-swap and lose state with no error. Surface a one-time
  warning, or document the required deps in the app template.

- **No Deno Deploy build preset.** Chevalier requires a manual `deno task build`
  before deploy since Deploy doesn't run Vite. Automating the build-then-deploy
  step would close the gap; today the template README's Deploy section documents
  the manual flow.
